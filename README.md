**Bias Detection and Debiasing System**

**Project Overview**

This project aims to detect and mitigate bias in textual data using machine learning models, including fine-tuned BERT and GPT-based approaches. The system identifies biased text, highlights bias probability at the token level, and generates debiased alternatives while preserving the original meaning.

Features

Bias Detection: Uses a BERT-based model to classify text as biased or unbiased.

Token-wise Bias Analysis: Provides visual representation of token importance and bias probability.

Bias Validation: Evaluates model performance using standard metrics like precision, recall, and F1-score.

Text Debiasing: Leverages a fine-tuned LLM (T5 model) to generate unbiased text alternatives.

Data Processing: Handles dataset preprocessing and embedding generation for training and evaluation.
